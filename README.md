TabGroup
========

Chrome extension that allows users to create groupings of links/urls/internet pages. Users can choose to open the items within the indicated grouping all at once in different tabs. Useful if you want to open specific links every time your open your browser depending on your purposes (groups can contain things you might want to differentiate ie: fun and games, work, coding, readings, art history class, trip planning).
